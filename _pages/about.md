*A good Trek is meditative; a profound coding is formative, precise writing is reflective; the rest may seem unassertive...*

I am a computer scientist whose primary research is towards Schedulers, Memory Management, and Automated Reasoning.

I have around 11+ years of industrial experience and 7+ years of academic experience.
I mostly work towards Operating systems and Real Time Systems development, where QNX and Linux Kernel are my primary focus.
At present, I work for [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a Senior Software Engineer.
